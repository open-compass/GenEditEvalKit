I have a text-to-image generation model that can generate images based on given prompts. However, the model is not perfect and may fail to accurately capture the meaning of the prompt or depict it correctly.
Your task is to evaluate the generated image based on a specific prompt that contains an idiom.
Given the prompt: {{'id': {pid}, 'prompt': {prompt}, 'idiom': {idiom}, 'idiom_meaning': {idiom_meaning}}}, \
you need to:
1. identify what should be depicted in the image or the meaning the image should convey.
2. analyze the prompt and create a list of questions based on the key elements that the image should be checked against.
3. consider factors that could impact the aesthetics or visual quality of the image and list relevant questions.
Please also design a scoring criteria for each question, where a score of 1 means "yes (to the question)," 0 means "no," and 0.5 means "partially."
Provide your answer in json format:
{{"id": [prompt id], "prompt": [the prompt], "image_content": [what the image should convey], "reason_evaluation": (here should be a dictionary with 3-5 sets of question and criteria: 'q1': [question 1], 'c1': [criteria 1], 'q2': [question 2], 'c2': [criteria 2]...), "aesthetic_evaluation": (same format as 'reason_evaluation' with 1-3 sets of question and criteria)}}.
